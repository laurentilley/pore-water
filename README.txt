This project is about applying phosphorus spiked water to plots in a forested site to investigate the fate and transport of phosphorus in soils. This data is obtained from lysimeters that lay in the middle of each of the 25 plots. From these pore water samples, we can learn about how the phosphorus does or doesn't move down the soil profile and in what form.
